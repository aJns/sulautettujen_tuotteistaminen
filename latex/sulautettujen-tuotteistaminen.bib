abstract = {Wireless microsensor networks have been identified as one of the most important technologies for the 21st century. This paper traces the history of research in sensor networks over the past three decades, including two important programs of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) spanning this period: the Distributed Sensor Networks (DSN) and the Sensor Information Technology (SensIT) programs. Technology trends that impact the development of sensor networks are reviewed, and new applications such as infrastructure security, habitat monitoring, and traffic control are presented. Technical challenges in sensor network development include network discovery, control and routing, collaborative signal and information processing, tasking and querying, and security. The paper concludes by presenting some recent research results in sensor network algorithms, including localized algorithms and directed diffusion, distributed tracking in wireless ad hoc networks, and distributed classification using local agents.},

@article{Kaelbling1996,
abstract = {This paper surveys the field of reinforcement learning from a computer-science perspective. It is written to be accessible to researchers familiar with machine learning. Both the historical basis of the field and a broad selection of current work are summarized. Reinforcement learning is the problem faced by an agent that learns behavior through trial-and-error interactions with a dynamic environment. The work described here has a resemblance to work in psychology, but differs considerably in the details and in the use of the word ``reinforcement.'' The paper discusses central issues of reinforcement learning, including trading off exploration and exploitation, establishing the foundations of the field via Markov decision theory, learning from delayed reinforcement, constructing empirical models to accelerate learning, making use of generalization and hierarchy, and coping with hidden state. It concludes with a survey of some implemented systems and an assessment of the practical utility of current methods for reinforcement learning.},

@article{Tubaishat2003,
abstract = { Advances in hardware and wireless network technologies have created low-cost, low-power, multifunctional miniature sensor devices. These devices make up hundreds or thousands of ad hoc tiny sensor nodes spread across a geographical area. These sensor nodes collaborate among themselves to establish a sensing network. A sensor network can provide access to information anytime, anywhere by collecting, processing, analyzing and disseminating data. Thus, the network actively participates in creating a smart environment.},

@article{Arya2015,
abstract = {? 2015 ACM.In wireless sensor networks, data routing in an optimal way is a challenging task while tackling the limited energy constraint at the same time. Our goal is not only to enhance network's lifetime for the available limited network energy, but also to detect the sub-areas in the network, which have run out of energy or became a dead zone i.e. hole. The hole detection algorithm used in our work detects such dead zones and help the network coordinators to mitigate the problem before it hampers the whole network functioning. The simulation results have shown the ability of the protocol to optimally route data packets in a multiple sink scenario and detect hole(s) when it occurs. Our work on holes covers coverage hole detection and routing hole detection.},
