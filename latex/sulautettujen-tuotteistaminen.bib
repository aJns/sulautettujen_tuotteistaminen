abstract = {? 2015 ACM.In wireless sensor networks, data routing in an optimal way is a challenging task while tackling the limited energy constraint at the same time. Our goal is not only to enhance network's lifetime for the available limited network energy, but also to detect the sub-areas in the network, which have run out of energy or became a dead zone i.e. hole. The hole detection algorithm used in our work detects such dead zones and help the network coordinators to mitigate the problem before it hampers the whole network functioning. The simulation results have shown the ability of the protocol to optimally route data packets in a multiple sink scenario and detect hole(s) when it occurs. Our work on holes covers coverage hole detection and routing hole detection.},
